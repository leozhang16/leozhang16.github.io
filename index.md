### CPSC 120
* Lab 1
    Lab 1 holds special place as it introduced me to C++ programming. The task was brief and straightfoward, yet it evokes fond memories and represents a meaningful time in my academic career. As I progress in my future career, I will continue to cherish the experience and its impact on my learning journey.
* Lab 7
    My second favorite lab, lab 7 part 2, delved into the mechanics of blackjack, a game I have always enjoyed playing due to its simplicity. This lab also provided me with valuable insights into passing command-line arguments to the main code. The knowledge I gained from this lab will for sure be critical in my future career.
* Lab 9 
    Lab 9, part 2 addressed writing and reading text files. This concept is particularly intriguing, as it enables the main function to access data stored in external files, leading numerous possibilities. By mastering these techniques, I will be able to develop code that streamlines my workflow and promote efficiency in all my projects in the future.
